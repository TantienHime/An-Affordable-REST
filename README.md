# BSFinalProject

An Affordable REST
This is my final project at BrainStation.io

The City of TOronto has over a 5 year waiting list for affordable housing. In order to determine which development that a seeker can apply to, they must speak with someone at Toronto Community Housing. What if this information was not only made available through open data, but made available on a website? Think of the benefits to those in need.

Technologies used: React.JS, Node.JS, API, Web Scraping.
